Welcome to CHAOSS Accessibilty! We're super excited to have you want to contribute to our project.

## Introduction
We use the NVDA screen reader, Wave evaluation tool, Screen reader extension during this review. This testing follows the WCAG "POUR" guidelines found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). Our aim is to achieve a WCAG 2.1 - AA Level compliance with this audit.

## Repository specific guidelines

-**Open a new Issue**
Issues for which accessibilty testing will be conducted are typically opened by the core team members & the project managers. However, if you encountered any challenges while using any of CHAOSS projects websites or you have any inquiry on accessibilty, kindly go ahead and open an issue using any of the options listed below. To avoid duplicates, please take a moment to look through open issues. Also try to provide accurate descriptions, point us to the exact page by sharing the link, screenshot & what OS (Web, IOS or Android) your're viewing it from. This will help us get to it faster.

* If you would just like to point us to an accessibility issue you noticed, please feel free to open a [blank issue](https://github.com/chaoss/Accessibility/issues/new) and one of our core contributors will determine if a similar issue has already been created for it. 

-**Fix an Issue**
If you would like to fix an open issue, please leave a comment on it so that it can be assigned to you.

-**Contributing timeline after an issue has been assigned**
* For conducting accessibility checks: After you have indicated interest on a particular issue, a **One week** window is given for each test assigned to you. This is to ensure that things move quickly and any other person interested can indicate their interest without assuming you're working on it. Life happens, so if you run into any challenges or need more time, please let the team know.
* For fixing issues found durring accessibilty audits: After you have indicated interest on a particular issue, a **Two week** window is given for each test assigned to you. This is to ensure that things move quickly and any other person interested can indicate their interest without assuming you're working on it. Life happens, so if you run into any challenges or need more time, please let the team know.
